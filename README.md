EN | [中文](README_zh.md)



### Overview
CH641 series is a dedicated microcontroller for PD wireless charging designed based on barley RISC-V2A core. This series has the characteristics of wide voltage, single line debugging, low power consumption and compact peripheral.
CH641 built-in PD PHY, BC interface, differential input current sampling and AC small signal amplification decoder.
The CH641 has built-in PD PHY, BC interface, differential input current sampling and AC small signal amplifier/decoder, supports USB PD and Type C fast charging, BC1.2 and DCP and other HV charging protocols, and provides DMA controller, 10-bit ADC, multi-group timer and DMA controller.
DMA controller, 10-bit analog-to-digital converter ADC, multi-group timer, USART serial port, I2C and other rich peripheral resources, over-voltage protection and over-temperature protection.
